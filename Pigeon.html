<div class="animal_description">

    <p>
        he domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) is a pigeon subspecies that was derived from the rock dove (also
        called the rock pigeon). The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird. Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets
        mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do Egyptian hieroglyphics.[2] Research
        suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago.[2]

        Pigeons have made contributions of considerable importance to humanity, especially in times of war.[3] In war
        the homing ability of pigeons has been put to use by making them messengers. So-called war pigeons have carried
        many vital messages and some have been decorated for their services. Medals such as the Croix de Guerre, awarded
        to Cher Ami, and the Dickin Medal awarded to the pigeons G.I. Joe and Paddy, amongst 32 others, have been
        awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives.

        Despite this, city pigeons today are seen as pests, mainly due to their droppings. Feral pigeons are considered
        invasive in many parts of the world, though they have a positive impact on wild bird populations, serving as an
        important prey species of birds of prey.[4]
