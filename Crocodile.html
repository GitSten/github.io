        Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the
        tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to
        include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family
        Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa.

        Although they appear similar, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The
        gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to
        spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with
        crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators
        and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and
        the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all
        teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower
        teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a
        constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable
        feature to define the species' family.[1] Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can
        better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but
        non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much
        higher levels of aggression.[2]

        Crocodile size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species. However, they have many
        similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater
        habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous
        animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates
        such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that, unlike
        alligators, are very sensitive to cold. They separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55
        million years ago.[3] Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically
        endangered.
